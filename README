lua-httpd
---------

  This directory contains four things:


    libhttpd.c - Some networking functions callable from Lua.
    httpd.lua  - A simple HTTP server written in Lua using them.
    client.lua - A simple HTTP client.
    Makefile   - To build ("make") and execute ("make test")

 (Before building make sure you run:
	apt-get install liblualib50-dev liblua50-dev )



libhttpd.c
----------

  This function exports simple wrappers to lua of the following
 networking primitives:

	bind();
	accept();
	connect();
	read();
	write();
	close();

  These are sufficient to write simple HTTP servers in Lua.



httpd.lua
---------

  This is an simple HTTP server which supports multiple virtual hosts.

  By default it will serve requests for files located beneath ./vhosts,
 each directory beneath there will be taken as a hostname to serve.

  The server will bind to port 4444 by default.

  The request to close it is:

	http://localhost:4444/finish


client.lua
----------

  This is a trivial HTTP client which will connect to
 http://localhost:80/ and output the index page.
