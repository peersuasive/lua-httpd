lua-httpd
---------

  This package contains a simple networking extension library for
 Lua 5.0 which is implemented and exported from a C shared library
 (.so).

  It may be installed system-wide and used by your Lua scripts with
 ease.



Installation
------------

  Compile and install the library with

	make

	make install

  This will install the library into the directory /usr/lib/lua/5.0 
 along with a helper package into /usr/share/lua50.



Usage
-----

  Once the library has been installed you can use it from your Lua
 scripts as follows:


[------- Example ------]
#!/usr/bin/lua

sockets = require "libhttpd";

print ( sockets.version .. " loaded OK" );
[ ----- ]


  If you do not wish to install the library system-wide you can
 instead use:

[------- Example ------]
#!/usr/bin/lua

socket = assert(loadlib("./libhttpd.so", "luaopen_libhttpd"))()

print ( sockets.version .. " loaded OK" );
[ ----- ]



Demonstration Code
------------------

  The package comes complete with several small examples inside the
 API documentation which you can find beneath the docs/ directory.


  More complete sample code is included:

  httpd.lua
  ---------

   A simple HTTP server written in Lua using the primitives.  This
  server understands virtual hosts, and will serve using your systems
  installed MIME types database.

   After you've installed the library you may execute the HTTPD by
  running "make test" - this will serve the content beneath ./vhosts
  to clients.

   To stop the server fetch:

		http://localhost:4444/finish


  client.lua
  ----------

   A very simple HTTP client written in Lua using the primitives.
