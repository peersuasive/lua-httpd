 <h2>Example Code using lua-httpd</h2>
 <blockquote>
 <p>Here are some simple samples of code demonstrating how the library may be used.</p>
 <p>The library includes a couple of small samples of its own which have better error handling, and more complete functionality.  However these samples are simpler for demonstration purposes.</p>

 <h3>Simple Server</h3>



 <h3>Simple Client</h3>
 <p>The following implements a simple client, connecting to http://localhost/
 and retrieving the headers of a page request.</p>
<pre>
  -- Load the library
  socket = require( "libhttpd" );

  -- Make a connection to http://localhost/
  sock = socket.connect( "localhost", 80 );

  -- Send the request.
  socket.write( sock, "GET / HTTP/1.0\n\n" );

  -- Read the response and print it
  repeat
     len,line = socket.read( sock )
     print( line );
  until len <= 0

  -- Close up
  socket.close( sock );
</pre>
